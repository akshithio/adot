# adot

ðŸ”¨: You can run it by simply cloning, running `cargo build --release` followed by `cargo install --path .`. Built in Rust.

`adot` is a simple supplementary tool I built for my personal website in order to acquaint myself with Rust & CLI tooling. It contains a simple microblogging tool and a command to update my location that i display on my website. I might add more commands to it if it so becomes necessary over the future. In its current configuration, The path to the JSON file that contains the credentials for the firestore database, alongside the project name and a token to using `ipinfo` are hardcoded into my local `.zshrc` file, for the lack of a better solution.

![Preview image of what I built. It shows a terminal with the command "adot microblog 'Hello, World!" that shows successful execution and another command that reads "adot location" that also shows successful execution](./akshithio/preview.png)
